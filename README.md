# engduino-sensors
Measures temperature and light variation and uploads this data to an Azure app. Ideally the experiment would run for a full day, but to preview how the experiment would work the data is collected at 1 second intervals.

* Download repository
* Flash the Engduino with the `LightTemperatureVariation.ino`
* Open up the `UploaderGrapher.pde` in Processing and run
* Go to http://lightandtemperature.azurewebsites.net/ to see live data
